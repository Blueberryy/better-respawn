# Better Respawn

This mod adds a mechanic that lets you respawn near your death location.

The minimum and maximum distance from your death location is configurable.

You will still respawn at your bed if you return from the end or if you die in another dimension.

You will also respawn at your bed if you are within a certain distance of it.
This distance is also configurable.
